# OOP - Object Oriented Programming

## There are four pillars
```
1. Inheritance (most used) - Eliminates redundant code. We can use all functions and variable from parent class

2. Encapsulation - Reduce complexity and increase reusability. Also used to reduce access, making private methods/ variables etc.

3. Abstraction - Reduce complexity and isolate impact of changes.

4. Polymorphism (Many Forms) - Refactor code or case statements. It allows us to change behaviour or attributes / variables
```

# In Python, everything is an object!
```
- A variable (object) is just an instance of its type (class).
- That's why when you check the type of a variable you can see the class keyword right next to its type (class).

--> The class is a blueprint for an object.
```
